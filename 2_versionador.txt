Step 0

    Login

Step 1

    Create a Repository

        https://github.com/new

            Repository name:
            Description:
            Public or private:

            Optional

                Add readme
                Add .gitignore    
                Add license

Step 2

    Get the repository locally 

        Clone command

            git clone <url>

            This command Clone a repository into a new directory (from url)

            Clone Repository

                git clone https://github.com/gerardoangeles/cs50.git

        Create a file into local repository

            For example you can create a file with: touch hello.html 

        Add command

            git add <filename>

            This command Add file contents to the index

            Add a file to the index

                git add hi.html

        Commit command

            git commit -m "reason why changes are recorded in the repository"

            This command record changes to the repository

            Commit the file

                git commit -m "probando registro en repositorio 15-Ago-2021 11:13"

        Status command

            git status 

            This command Show the working tree status

        Push command

            git push

            This command update remote refs along with associated objects

Step 3

    Make a change to any file in the local repository

        Status command

            git status 

            Maybe you see:

                Changes not staged for commit:

                    modified:   fileName.html

                Untracked files:

                    someFile.txt     

        Commit -am command               

            commit -am "the reason for the recording"

            The switches:

            -a or  --all

            Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not told Git about are not affected.

            -m <msg> or --message=<msg>
            
            Use the given <msg> as the commit message. If multiple -m options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs.

        Push command

            git push

            (update remote refs)

        Is all ok?

        error: failed to push some refs to <url>

            hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
            hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
            hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
            hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
            hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

        Pull command

            git pull

            This command  Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch

        Push command (again)

            git push

            (again update remote refs)

Step 4

    There are new changes in the remote repository.

        Pull command

            git pull

Step 5

    git commit
    git pull

    Merge

        git merge 

        This command Join two or more development histories together

Step 6
